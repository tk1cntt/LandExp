            <div className="summary">
              France's interior minister has been grilled by MPs over his handling of a policing scandal in which a presidential security
              aide was filmed assaulting a demonstrator on 1 May.
            </div>
            <div className="content">
              <p>
                GÃ©rard Collomb said he learned of the video on 2 May and did not report it to prosecutors because it was a matter for
                President Emmanuel Macron's staff.
              </p>
              <p>Mr Macron fired the aide, Alexandre Benalla, on Friday, but MPs want to know why he did not act sooner.</p>
              <p>Mr Benalla, 26, faces several charges.</p>
              <p>
                He is accused of assault with an accomplice, interfering in police work, impersonating a police officer and illegally
                receiving surveillance footage.
              </p>
              <p>
                On Monday Mr Benalla, who was Mr Macron's top bodyguard during last year's election campaign, defended his actions, claiming
                that he was "lending a hand" to the riot officers at the scene after he was "invited to observe" their operations.
